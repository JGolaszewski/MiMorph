# MiMorph

MiMorph leverages feature extraction techniques to create smooth transitions between microscopic images, enabling enhanced visualization and analysis of cellular structures. This approach facilitates the generation of intermediate images to aid interpretation in biological and clinical applications.

## About

**MiMorph** focuses on:
- Extracting key features from microscopic images.
- Generating smooth transitions between images.
- Supporting biological and clinical research by improving the visual interpretation of cellular structures.

This project aims to enhance the quality of microscopic image analysis by producing intermediary images that highlight progressive structural changes.

## Installation

> Requirements and installation instructions will be provided soon.

For now, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mimorph.git
cd mimorph
```

## Usage

> Detailed usage examples and command-line options will be added as the project evolves.

Currently, the project includes preliminary data exploration tools for microscopic images.

## Examples

Here are some early examples of what MiMorph can generate:

- Initial feature extraction from sample datasets
- Early-stage transition mapping between images

More detailed examples and visualizations will be provided in future updates.
